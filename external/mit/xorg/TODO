libs
	-- libGL has has glapi_x86.S commented out from the
	   build because it spews when eating -traditional-cpp
	   cheap whitespace hacks have been discussed or
	   phone suggested we only pass -traditional-cpp to
	   platforms where assemblers do things with '#'.


upgrade issues:
	- new Mesa has glslcompiler -- do we want it?
